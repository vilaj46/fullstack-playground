# Auth Flow Overview

1. **User logs in** with username and password.

2. **Server verifies** credentials and creates a **session cookie** (short-lived access token or session ID).

3. **Server generates a refresh token**, storing it securely in cache (e.g., Redis or database).

4. **Server sends the refresh token** as a secure, httpOnly cookie to the client.

5. Authenticated routes grab the access token from cookies.

6. Middleware verifies the access token before proceeding.

7. If middleware verification fails with a 401, the client intercepts the response and triggers the refresh token flow.

8. The client sends the refresh token from cookies to the server.

9. The server verifies the refresh token against its cache.

10. If valid, the server creates a new session (access) token and updates the cookie.

//NextJS

Server Components (e.g. layout.tsx, page.tsx):

Use cookies() to access and verify tokens on the server.

Ideal for SSR auth + rendering protected pages.

API Routes (/app/api/...):

Use server middleware to guard private endpoints.

Works exactly like any Express backend.

Middleware (middleware.ts):

Runs before routing â€” good for blocking access to certain pages if user is not authenticated.

Client Components:

Use fetch, and your axios interceptor to automatically retry via refresh tokens.

// TODO

Token Rotation (optional but recommended):
When you issue a new access token, you can also issue a new refresh token and replace the old one in both cookie and cache. This reduces risk if a refresh token is leaked.

Revoke Refresh Tokens:
Provide a way to revoke refresh tokens (e.g., logout or suspicious activity). When revoked, the refresh token is removed from the cache and can no longer be used.

Handle Refresh Token Expiry:
If the refresh token itself expires or is missing/invalid during refresh attempts, force the user to log in again (hard logout).

Secure Cookie Flags:
Set HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite flags on cookies to reduce attack surface (XSS, CSRF).

Rate Limiting / Brute Force Protection:
Apply rate limiting on login and refresh endpoints to avoid abuse.

Logging and Monitoring:
Log refresh token usage and failures for audit and anomaly detection.
